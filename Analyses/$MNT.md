Mantle is quietly transforming from just another L2 to the heartbeat of Bybit. 

What began as BitDAO’s token is now Bybit’s backbone, fueling a structural demand loop most can only dream of. 

Think BNB but with fresher mechanics and an even stronger runway.

#### Catalysts for its Moonshot:

###### Bybit Utility Explosion 
- Holding MNT gives trading fee discounts of 25% on spot, 10% off on perps
- MNT can be used as collateral power offering higher LTV ratios for leveraged trading
- Institutional perks such as extended loan terms and preferential benefits for holding MNT

###### Deflationary Potential
- Bybit’s revenue fueled buyback and burn could flip MNT deflationary. 

Historically this has been one of the strongest drivers of exchange token reratings, with OKB/BNB as precendent.

###### Undervalued Metrics: 
- At $1.4, Mantle trades at just 1/30th of BNB’s MCAP while Bybit is already doing 1/3rd of Binance’s volumes. 
That disconnect is absurd. 

Conservative comps suggest a 3–6x re-rating, with moonshot scenarios stretching way higher.

##### Ecosystem Backstop
- Mantle still runs its modular L2, backed by a $4B treasury and $200M EcoFund. Even if the Bybit story takes a pause, the chain utility keeps the thesis alive.

#### TLDR;
👉Rare convergence point: Mantle mirrors the early playbook that made BNB & OKB giants

👉Fresh mechanics: Upgraded tokenomics with buyback/burn potential

👉Deep integration: Institutional perks and Bybit-wide utility

👉Mispriced opportunity: Valuation still lags far behind peers
