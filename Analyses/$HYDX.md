Momentum around $BASE is building after yesterday’s hint, smart money is quietly scooping up tokens. 

@HydrexFi / $HYDX is leading onchain flows, clearing $50M in trading volume less than a day since its TGE.

What is Hydrex?

- A MetaDEX + liquidity infrastructure layer built on and for Base.
- Aggregates liquidity from multiple sources, enabling efficient swaps and routing.
- Runs on an upgraded ve(3,3) model, combining vote-escrow incentives with cooperative emissions.

$HYDX is well positioned to capture the same liquidity that took $AERO to hundreds of millions.

Bullish outlook
- Strategic Protocol Reserve: No HYDX enters circulation unless USDC flows in (via oHYDX → HYDX redemptions).

- Tokenomics: Team & treasury allocations are locked; 90%+ supply permanently locked.

- Grants & ecosystem support: Superchain grant from Optimism (600k+ in Aug). Base has also spotlighted Hydrex; strong ties across the Base ecosystem.

- Solid Partners: Chainlink, Frax Finance, Clanker on Base.

- Onchain traction:

👉 $10M TVL

👉 $57M volume 

👉 $320K fees in first 24h

👉 $5M liquidity pool

Why You Shouldn't Fade $HYDX

- Brings a liquidity-neutral, omni-DEX model to Base, complementary to, not cannibalizing, existing pools.

- Transparent team (doxxed, prior products) with no VC funding, no cliffs, no vesting.

- Early metrics show strong demand and healthy fee generation.

- With emissions + revenue distribution set to go live on Sept 18, the coming weeks will test whether this flywheel can scale toward the $100M TVL mark.

Hydrex is a clean, capital-efficient alternative to Aerodrome and it’s still extremely EARLY!
