#### Published Sep 25, 2025
@stbl_official is already above a $400M market cap, up 1500%+ since TGE, and leading flows on BNB. 

Smart money is front-running $STBL, here’s why $1 looks inevitable 👇

### What is STBL?

👉 Governance + utility token for the STBL Protocol.

👉 Users mint $USST (USD stablecoin) with yield-bearing RWAs (Ondo USDY, BlackRock BUIDL, Franklin Templeton BENJI).

👉 Yield separated into a YLD NFT, enabling liquidity and earnings.

👉 Over-collateralized (103–105%), transparent, with 4–5% APY from real-world assets.

### Positives:

👉  Founding team: Reeve Collins (Tether) + Avtar Sehra (tokenization pioneer).

👉  Backed by institutions: Franklin Templeton minted $100M USST; $500M+ in commitments; Wave Digital ($1B AUM).

👉  3-token model: $USST (liquidity), $YLD NFT (yield), $STBL (governance + buybacks).

👉  Revenue flywheel: 100% of mint/redeem fees go to $STBL buybacks (on-chain).

👉  Narrative fit: Aligned with RWAs + stablecoin regulation tailwinds.

### Risks:

👉 Insider heavy: ~76% supply insider-held; FDV ~$4B.

👉 Utility narrow: Mostly governance today; adoption key.

### Why It Matters:

👉 One of the first stablecoin protocol that returns all revenue to holders.

👉 Backed by major institutions + strong early traction (Kraken listing, Binance soon).

👉 Buybacks start Q4 , primed to fuel CT’s “buyback meta.”

At $400M vs Tether’s $500B, $STBL is early.
It is well positioned as a yield-bearing, institutionally aligned Stablecoin 2.0.
