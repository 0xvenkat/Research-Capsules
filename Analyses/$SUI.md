# SUI Breakout Imminent
##### Published Sep 2nd, 2025
$SUI has once again held its ground at a key support zone, the third successful defense of this level. A clear sign that buyers continue to step in with conviction. 

1W chart shows the formation of a textbook Ascending Triangle. The longer price holds under resistance, the more energy builds for the eventual breakout.

The level to watch is $4.4. A clean close above it would confirm momentum and set the stage for a push toward double digits.

TA is further reinforced by Fundamentals:
Network growth: Sui Intern data shows 285M+ accounts now live on the network.

Supply contraction: Over 1.9M SUI will be permanently removed from circulation via burns and freezes.

Institutional confidence: SUI Group Holdings added 20M tokens this week, bringing their treasury to 101.8M SUI, while still holding $58M cash for future accumulation.

### Trade Setup
Current Price: $3.3
Entry: Above $3.3
SL: Below $2.6

Targets: $4 → $5 → $7 → $10
