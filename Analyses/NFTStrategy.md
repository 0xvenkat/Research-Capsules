# NFTStrategy (platform behind $PNKSTR and $BIRBSTR) is carving out an entirely new meta: 
#### Published Oct 2nd, 2025

- NFT-backed tokens designed to run perpetually via automated buy & sell loops 
- exposure to bluechip projects
- deflationary cycle through automated burn mechanism

A start of something much bigger 👇

### Whats NFTStrategy?

at its core, NFTStrategy is a framework of smartcontracts that allows any NFT collection to launch its own strategy token.  

it includes mechanics designed to benefit both the token holders and the underlying NFT project.

Here’s how the flywheel works:

👉 every trade incurs a 10% fee.

👉 8% flows into an NFT accumulation pool to buy floor NFTs of the associated collection.

👉 the NFTs are relisted at a markup (typically 1.2x)

👉 once sold, proceeds are used to buy and burn the strategy token, permanently reducing supply

👉 1% of fees flows back to creators and another 1% to $PNKSTR, reinforcing long-term ecosystem sustainability.

it’s a perpetual loop: more volume → more NFT buys → more relistings → more burns → tighter token supply. 

Decentralized, Onchain, and Automated.
No middlemen, No counterparty risk.

#### PunkStrategy is the flagship of NFTStrategy which taps into the cultural and financial weight of CryptoPunks

👉 19 CryptoPunks are already held in treasury, putting $PNKSTR among the top Punk collectors.

👉 fees continuously accumulate ETH for more Punk buys, compounding exposure.

👉 current at FDV is 124m which puts FDV/Revenue  ~0.6x. Substantially lower at comparable projects ~4x.

$PNKSTR could easily reach a $200–500M FDV, representing 10–20% of the total CryptoPunks market cap.

in many ways its like a Punk derivative except deflationary, which no traditional derivative can replicate.

following $PNKSTR’s lead, 

BirbStrategy has quickly distinguished itself as the second-largest strategy by leveraging the Moonbirds collection: 

👉 $BIRBSTR recently reached critical volume, directly moving the Moonbirds floor.

👉 in a single day: $1.5M trading volume → $120k used to buy ~8–9 Moonbirds.

👉 15 Moonbirds sold for 51 ETH, all proceeds burned 2.27% of supply in 24 hours.

BirbStrategy has surpassed $APESTR (Bored Apes), $PUDGYSTR (Pudgy Penguins) strategies.

Do the Premiums Make Sense?

one can argue that strategy tokens are trading at premiums far above the value of their underlying treasuries, 

however this premium reflects the reflexive nature of the model:

👉 unlike traditional treasuries, NFTStrategy tokens are fixed supply (no dilution risk)

👉 every loop is deflationary, compressing supply while expanding exposure to underlying NFTs.

👉 more trading volume equals exponential compounding of both NFT holdings and burns.

in short, this isn’t just a treasury token; it’s a token that fuels its own growth.

### Final thoughts:

although NFTStrategy is still in its infancy, it’s taking up mindshare to become one of the most creative and promising experiments in crypto. 

PunkStrategy and BirbStrategy reveal how explosive the dynamics can get once volume compounds. 

the meta is just beginning. 

#### TLDR;
NFTStrategy establishes an automated loop that combines the hype of memecoins and the culture behind jpegs. 

as long as there is trading activity, the music doesn't stop.

beyond the short-term FUD, NFTStrategy seems like a narrative that is an entirely new asset class in motion.
