# $PMX
#### Published Oct 3rd, 2025

A new prediction market just launched on Solana with 
@MeteoraAG backing and almost no one’s talking about it.

If Hyperliquid and Pump.fun had a prediction market baby, it’d be $PMX.

@pmx_trade is launchpad for prediction markets, fully native and tradable across Solana.

Anyone can create markets via a presale model, instantly minting YES/NO SPL tokens that integrate across Solana wallets and trading terminals.

This makes prediction markets composable DeFi primitives instead of siloed platforms.

### Key Features

👉 Permissionless Launches: Markets can go live with as little as $1K liquidity.

👉 Deep Liquidity Rails: Built on Meteora’s DAMM v2, ensuring scalable liquidity.

👉 Cross-Ecosystem Trading: YES/NO tokens trade natively across Solana DEXs.

👉 Aligned Incentives: Both creators and liquidity providers directly share fees.

👉 Transparent Resolution: Currently internal, with roadmap to automated AI-based resolution.

### Creator Rewards

👉 Earn 10% of all trading fees generated by their market.

👉 Unlimited upside, encourages creators to promote and grow their markets.

### Liquidity Providers (LPs)

👉 100% refund of contributed USDC at settlement.

👉 Earn 40% of market trading fees, proportional to presale share.

👉 No impermanent loss: risk-free initial investment.

Example: Contribute $2,500 to a presale, representing 10% of the total. 

Market generates $15,000 in trading fees, 
You receive your initial $2,500 + $600 in fee rewards (40% of $15,000 × 10% = $600).

$PMX lets you earn passive income on real-world events, instead of being tied to ETH or meme hype

### Market Context

Polymarket: ~$12B annualized trading volume, billion+ valuation.

Kalshi: $2B valuation (regulated US exchange).

Cap.bet: Raised $6.9M pre-seed.
